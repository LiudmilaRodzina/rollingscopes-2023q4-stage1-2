## Presentation Transcript:

Hi, my name is Liudmila and I am a student at the Rolling Scopes School, Front-end course.

First of all, I would like to apologize for the quality of this video.

Now to the topic.

I got interested in IT quite unexpectedly not long ago, in 2022.
Before that, I dropped out of a Teachers’ Training University and joined a large cruise ship company in the United States.
It was a great adventure. I managed to visit lots of beautiful places all over the world and meet wonderful people there.
Anyway, I stayed there for 5 years and came back home, to my Homeland.
I graduated from the Belarusian State Economic University with a degree in Hospitality Management.
And then I got disappointed in the hospitality industry in Belarus.

Then I changed several jobs, mostly related to customer interaction.
And my last place of work was a small IT-company.
That is when I realized that programming is something I might like trying.
I started with poking Python a little bit, but in a couple of months I realized that JavaScript is probably going to be more suitable for me.

I remember, how exciting it was when I saw the first “Hello, world!” appear in the window of my browser.
And then I applied some CSS styles. And it was “wow!”
And later, with Javascript, I could do things I could have never imagined I would.

To cut a long story short, in the autumn of 2022, I was lucky to find out about a Front-end development course from The Rolling Scopes School.
It was extremely challenging for me. I couldn't keep up with the speed of the course and I dropped out of it almost at the very beginning.
Then there were other attempts to conquer the educational program of the school and now I am here.

What I’ve managed to learn so far? Well, to some extent:

- HTML and CSS (including CSS preprocessor SASS);
- Basic JavaScript;
- Git & GitHub;
- I also used Webpack, Vite and Parcel for building my projects;
- And I learned a little bit about Node.js;
- And some other things.

Even though my results are not that perfect at the moment, I am really happy with my accomplishments.
Mostly, because I’ve managed not to give up in moments of numerous weaknesses. And there were lots of them.
I’ve realized how important it is to move forward step by step, and focus on positive moments.

I am so excited to continue my studies, to master new technologies and to deepen the existing knowledge of web development.
I really find each and every topic so interesting, and I can't even imagine how much more there is to learn. I'm really looking forward to it.

Well, basically, that's it. I think it's time to round up. Thank you for your time. And take care, stay safe.
