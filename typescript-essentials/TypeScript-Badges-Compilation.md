## Reflections

My personal reflections on what I've learned in each module and how it contributes to my development skills:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**:
   I've found out that TypeScript is an improvement over JavaScript for web development and the core feature of TypeScript is its type system.
   I've installed Typescript, set up a project in Visual Studio Code and thus I will be able to use Typescript for my future projects.

2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**:
   I've learned that the main benefit of TypeScript is that it enables me to add static types to my JavaScript code.
   Types place static constraints on program entities, so that compilers and development tools can offer better verification and assistance during development.
   Now I know how to declare variables using primitive types, object types, union and intersection types.
   I am able to better document the intention of my code, which will help me and other developers understand it.

3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**:
   I've come to know that the main reason for using an interface in TypeScript is to define object types.
   I've learned how to declare, instantiate and extend an interface.
   Knowing that interfaces can extend each other enables me to copy the members of one interface into another, giving me more flexibility in how I separate my interfaces into reusable components.

4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**:
   I've realized that TypeScript simplifies the development and troubleshooting of functions by enabling developers to type parameters and return values.
   I've learned how to create functions that have required, optional, default, and rest parameters.
   It's become clear to me that typed functions will be especially important when I am working with larger code bases or functions developed by others because TypeScript clarifies the required input and output types.

6. **Generics in TypeScript**:
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**:
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**:
